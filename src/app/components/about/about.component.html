<h1 class="bout">ABOUT ME</h1>
<p id="aboutme">I am Alex-oni Olawale and I started out with a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Lagos, Nigeria. Over the years, I have pursued various professions and careers, eventually transitioning to become a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
<p id="aboutme">I chose to pursue a career in Full Stack Web Development due to my keen interest, which stemmed from my love for scientific logic patterns. In today's world, there are few professions that require the same level of logical thinking and problem-solving skills as web development.</p>
<p id="aboutme">Throughout my journey, I have worked hard to earn a Bachelor's degree in Physics, a Master's in Logistics, and even pursued a career in Occupational Health and Safety, obtaining a supervisory and inspectorate HSE course with Nebosh IGC certifications, all leading up to my web development career.</p>
<p id="aboutme">I work well in team environments and also have the necessary motivation to succeed in more solitary positions. I am detail-oriented, possess strong organizational skills, and thrive in fast-paced jobs that allow me to multitask. I believe in ongoing education to keep myself current in my chosen profession.</p>
<p id="aboutme">I have a keen eye for detail and can often spot future problems that others might overlook. I possess the knowledge to put together a plan to correct any issues found and implement the corrections in a timely fashion.</p>
<p id="aboutme">With excellent communication skills and a declarative approach to my operations, I possess the interpersonal skills needed to work well with other employees and management, and to function effectively as a team in achieving a common goal.</p>
